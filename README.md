### Principles for Minimizing GitHub Repositories and Increasing Code Reusability within the Apps Team:
1. Modularity: Encourage a modular code structure where each logical component or driver is encapsulated in its own module or directory. This allows for easier reuse of specific functionalities across different code examples.
2. Abstraction: Abstract standard functionalities into reusable functions, classes, or libraries. Extracting reusable code into separate modules can reduce duplication and simplify maintenance efforts across different code examples.
3. Dependency Management: Utilising.MTB files in the "deps" folder to include various components.
4. Standardization: Establish coding standards and guidelines across your code examples. Consistent naming conventions, file structures, and coding styles make it easier to navigate and reuse code across different code
